```
UserId : unique identifier for each user

The API receives the request and sends it to the appropriate controller method.
```

```
The controller method makes a call to the method in service class.
```

```
The method in service class builds logic and retrieves or modifies data from the database, which is in turn given to controller class

## Project Summary

The User Management System is a Spring Boot project written in Java that enables basic functionality for managing users. This project is built using the Spring Boot framework. The project uses ArrayList as the data structure to store and manage user data.

The project includes four main components, the UserManagementController, the UserService, the UserDao, and the User class. The UserController class receives requests from the user interface layer and delegates them to the UserService. The UserService processes the request and retrieves or updates data from the UserDao. The UserDao uses an ArrayList data structure to store and manage user data, and the User class defines the user data model.
